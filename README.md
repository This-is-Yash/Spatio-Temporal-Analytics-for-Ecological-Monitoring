# Spatio-Temporal Analytics for Ecological Monitoring

### Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning Approach

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze environmental monitoring data using machine learning and big data analytics techniques.
The system identifies patterns in ecological data across **time and space** to support environmental protection and sustainable monitoring.
By applying machine learning models, the project aims to detect trends, anomalies, and environmental changes that can help researchers and policymakers make informed decisions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains environmental monitoring information such as:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Air quality index
* Geographic location (latitude and longitude)
* Timestamp information

The dataset represents ecological observations collected from environmental sensors and monitoring stations.
It enables **spatio-temporal analysis**, where patterns are studied across both **time and geographic space**.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard **data science workflow**:

1. **Data Collection**

   * Environmental datasets obtained from open data sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Data normalization
   * Feature selection

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Visualizing trends in environmental variables
   * Studying temporal patterns

4. **Machine Learning Implementation**

   * Applying clustering or classification models to detect environmental patterns.

5. **Visualization**

   * Graphical representation of results using Python visualization libraries.

## Machine Learning Model Used

The project uses machine learning algorithms for environmental pattern detection:

* **K-Means Clustering**
  Used to group environmental data points based on similarity.

* **Random Forest (Optional)**
  Used for predicting environmental trends.

These models help identify hidden patterns in large-scale ecological datasets.

## Results and Visualizations

The results include several visualizations such as:

* Time-series analysis of environmental variables
* Cluster distribution of ecological data
* Trend analysis graphs

Visualization libraries used include:

* Python plotting libraries for environmental data visualization
* Statistical charts for identifying environmental trends

The analysis demonstrates how machine learning can assist in **large-scale environmental monitoring and ecological data interpretation**.
